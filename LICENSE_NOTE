This project was initially started as a userspace testbed for kernel
and embedded development. In particular, some of this work has been
merged into the X15 and GNU Mach microkernels, which are licensed under
GPLv3 and GPLv2 respectively. Some of it is also used in proprietary
software.

As a result, files found both in this library and GPL covered projects
are actually double licensed. They can be reused from this library under
the 2-clause BSD license.
